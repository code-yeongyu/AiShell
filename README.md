## Getting Started ðŸš€

To begin using `AiShell`, start by installing it with pip:

```sh
pip install aishell
```

Once you've installed `AiShell`, you can start using it right away.
For example, to print "Hello World" using `AiShell`, enter the following command:

```sh
aishell 'print Hello World'
```

## Advanced Settings ðŸ› 

By default, `AiShell` is configured to use the reverse-engineered ChatGPT client and retrieve login information from your browser, so you don't need to configure anything to use `AiShell`. However, for those who want to use different models with an OpenAI API Key, you can configure it as follows:

1. Create an account on OpenAI.
1. Go to <https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys> and copy your API key.
1. Modify or create the `~/.aishell/config.json` file as follows:

  ```json
  {
      ...
      "language_model": <language model of your preference>, //"official_chatgpt" or "gpt3"
      "openai_api_key": <your OpenAI API key>
  }
  ```

Here, you can specify the language model of your preference, such as "official_chatgpt" or "gpt3", and add your OpenAI API key. This will enable AiShell to use the specified language model and API key when executing commands.
